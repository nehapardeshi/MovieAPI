# MovieCharactersAPI



## Getting started

This is a ASP.NET Web API built on .NET 6 using C# and Entity Framework Code First approach. It uses SQL Server database.

This application allows users to manage movies, characters and franchise information. The database stores the information about the characters, movies they appear in, and the franchises these movies belong to.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.
